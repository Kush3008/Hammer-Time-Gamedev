## Game Name: Hammer_Time

### Description:
This project is a simple HTML5 canvas-based game implemented using JavaScript. It features a player character controlled by the `W`, `A`, and `D` keys to navigate through various levels while avoiding obstacles and enemies. The game utilizes sprites for animations, collision detection, and level progression.
